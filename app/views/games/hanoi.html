                <p>The <b>Tower of Hanoi</b> (also called the <b>Tower of Brahma</b> or <b>Lucas' Tower</b>, and sometimes pluralized) is a mathematical game or puzzle. It consists of three rods, and a number of disks of different sizes which can slide onto any rod. The puzzle starts with the disks in a neat stack in ascending order of size on one rod, the smallest at the top, thus making a conical shape.</p>
                <p>The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another rod, obeying the following simple rules:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Only one disk can be moved at a time.</li>
                    <li>Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack i.e. a disk can only be moved if it is the uppermost disk on a stack.</li>
                    <li>No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>With three disks, the puzzle can be solved in seven moves. The minimum number of moves required to solve a Tower of Hanoi puzzle is 2<sup><i>n</i></sup> - 1, where <i>n</i> is the number of disks.</p>
